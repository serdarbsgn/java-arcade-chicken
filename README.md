# java-arcade-chicken

This was a really fun project to work for me. I had experience with c and c++ but not in java so I decided to do something like this to improve my abilities and also learn the language better. I don't own any of the sounds or pictures in this game and don't intend to earn anything from this project. I used version names merely for fun and for backtracking better so I won't have to write much again. Versions are not so huge differences and last versions are for better readibility dividing the code into the classes.
